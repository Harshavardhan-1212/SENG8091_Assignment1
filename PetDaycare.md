# Pet Daycare Onboarding System â€“ Client Meeting Prep

## ðŸ“Œ Purpose
To prepare for the first customer encounter by evaluating the material that is currently accessible, making reasonable assumptions, and creating relevant questions. Establishing a common understanding of the onboarding problems that owners, clients, and workers confront is our aim.

## ðŸ“‹ Initial Understanding of the Problem

### Stakeholders
- **Owners:** Frustrated with long employee onboarding (3+ months).
- **Employees:** Struggle with inconsistency and complexity in client onboarding.
- **Customers:** Find the onboarding process confusing and unstructured.

## ðŸ“‚ Assumptions
These assumptions are made based on the information available:
1. There is no standardized digital system for onboarding employees or clients.
2. Onboarding procedures are currently managed manually.
3. There is a mix of in-person and online interactions with clients.
